### 2. Three-Project Architecture Refactor

**Priority:** High
**Effort:** Medium (2-3 weeks)
**Benefits:** Better testability, cleaner separation of concerns

**Current:** Single CardLister.csproj with all code
**Target:** Three projects with clean boundaries

**New Structure:**
```
CardLister.App/           # Avalonia UI layer
├── Views/               # XAML views
├── Converters/          # Value converters
├── Styles/              # Themes and styles
├── Assets/              # Images, icons
├── App.axaml.cs         # DI setup, startup
└── ViewLocator.cs       # ViewModel → View mapping

CardLister.Core/         # Business logic (no UI refs)
├── ViewModels/          # All ViewModels
├── Models/              # Domain entities
├── Services/            # Service interfaces only
└── Helpers/             # Pure logic helpers

CardLister.Infrastructure/  # External integrations
├── Data/                   # EF Core, repositories
├── Services/               # Service implementations
├── ApiModels/              # API DTOs
└── Migrations/             # EF migrations
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Create new projects
2. Move files to appropriate projects
3. Update namespaces
4. Update ViewLocator (Core.ViewModels → App.Views)
5. Fix all references
6. Test thoroughly

**Breaking Changes:**
- Namespace changes require ViewLocator update
- DI registration moves to App project

### 3. Unit and Integration Tests

**Priority:** High
**Effort:** Medium (3-4 weeks)
**Benefits:** Confidence in refactoring, catch regressions

**Test Projects:**
```
CardLister.Core.Tests/
├── ViewModels/          # ViewModel unit tests
│   ├── ScanViewModelTests.cs
│   ├── InventoryViewModelTests.cs
│   └── PricingViewModelTests.cs
├── Helpers/
│   └── FuzzyMatcherTests.cs
└── Services/            # Mock-based tests
    └── CardRepositoryTests.cs

CardLister.Infrastructure.Tests/
├── Data/
│   └── CardRepositoryIntegrationTests.cs
└── Services/
    ├── OpenRouterScannerTests.cs  # Recorded responses
    └── CsvExportServiceTests.cs
```

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests: ViewModels with mocked services
- Integration tests: Database operations with in-memory SQLite
- API tests: Use recorded responses (VCR pattern)
- UI tests: Avalonia.Headless for critical flows

**Coverage Goals:**
- ViewModels: 80%+
- Services: 70%+
- Helpers: 90%+

### 4. Automated Price Scraping

**Priority:** High
**Effort:** High (4-6 weeks)
**Benefits:** Eliminates manual Terapeak/eBay lookups

**Current:** Opens browser, user manually checks prices
**Target:** Automated price lookup with multiple sources

**Approach Options:**

**Option A: eBay API (Recommended)**
- Use eBay Finding API for sold listings
- Requires eBay Developer account (free)
- Rate limits: 5,000 calls/day
- Pros: Official, reliable, no scraping issues
- Cons: Requires approval, API key management

**Option B: Web Scraping**
- Scrape eBay sold listings HTML
- Use HtmlAgilityPack or AngleSharp
- Pros: No API key needed
- Cons: Fragile (breaks when eBay changes HTML), legal gray area

**Option C: Terapeak Research API**
- Official eBay seller tool
- Requires eBay Store subscription ($30/month)
- Best data quality
- Pros: Most accurate pricing
- Cons: Subscription cost, limited to eBay sellers

**Recommended Implementation:**
```csharp
public interface IPriceScraperService
{
    Task<PriceDataResult> GetMarketPriceAsync(Card card);
}

public class PriceDataResult
{
    public decimal MedianSoldPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal AverageSoldPrice { get; set; }
    public int SoldCount { get; set; }
    public DateTime DataAsOf { get; set; }
    public List<RecentSale> RecentSales { get; set; }
}
```

**UI Changes:**
- PricingView: Add "Get Market Price" button
- Automatically populate EstimatedValue
- Show confidence interval (e.g., "$12-18 based on 15 sales")
- Cache results for 24 hours

**Configuration:**
- Settings → eBay API key
- Toggle auto-price vs manual
- Set price source priority (eBay, COMC, 130point)

---

## Medium Priority (6-12 Months)

### 5. Cloud Sync and Backup

**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** High (6-8 weeks)
**Benefits:** Multi-device access, automatic backup

**Approach Options:**

**Option A: Dropbox/OneDrive Sync**
- Store cards.db in cloud folder
- Let OS handle sync
- Pros: Simple, no backend needed
- Cons: Conflicts with simultaneous edits, requires user setup

**Option B: Custom Cloud Backend**
- Build REST API (ASP.NET Core)
- Store data in cloud SQL database
- Implement conflict resolution
- Pros: Full control, real-time sync
- Cons: High effort, hosting costs

**Option C: Supabase/Firebase**
- Use BaaS for data sync
- Built-in authentication
- Pros: Fast to implement, real-time
- Cons: Vendor lock-in, monthly costs

**Recommended: Hybrid Approach**
1. Keep local SQLite as primary (offline-first)
2. Add optional cloud sync via Supabase
3. Manual sync button + automatic on app close
4. Conflict resolution: last-write-wins with user prompt

### 6. Additional Export Formats

**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium (2-3 weeks per format)

**Target Platforms:**

**eBay Bulk Upload CSV:**
- Different column format than Whatnot
- Requires eBay category mapping

- Graded card support

**MySlabs (Graded Cards):**
- Focus on PSA/BGS graded
- Certification number validation
- Population report integration

**TCGPlayer (if expanding to TCG):**
- Trading card games (Pokemon, Magic, etc.)
- Different data model (set/card number)

### 7. Performance Optimizations

**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium (3-4 weeks)

**Current Issues:**
- InventoryView slows down with 500+ cards
- Full card list loaded into memory
- No pagination or virtualization

**Optimizations:**

**Database Indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_card_status ON Cards(Status);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_sport ON Cards(Sport);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_player ON Cards(PlayerName);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_pricedate ON Cards(PriceDate);
```

**Pagination:**
- Load 50 cards at a time
- Virtual scrolling in DataGrid
- Background loading with progress indicator

**Lazy Loading:**
- Don't load images until visible
- Thumbnail generation and caching
- Use ImageBrush with UriSource

**Caching:**
- Cache frequently accessed data (checklists)
- In-memory cache with expiration
- Reduce database round-trips

### 8. Dark Theme Support

**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Low (1-2 weeks)

**Implementation:**
- Avalonia supports theme switching
- Create dark version of AppStyles.axaml
- Add theme toggle in Settings
- Persist preference
- System theme detection (Windows/macOS)

**Color Palette:**
- Light theme: Current Fluent theme
